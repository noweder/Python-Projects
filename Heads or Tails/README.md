## Heads or Tails

# Instructions

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails". 

**Important**, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

e.g.
1 means Heads
0 means Tails 

# Example Output

```
Heads
```

or

```
Tails
```
